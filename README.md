# StarcraftAnalysis

The proposed procedure for solving the problem of predicting a player's rank using Starcraft player performance data involves several key steps. First, we import the necessary libraries and load the dataset. Next, we perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or correlations. We then preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The model with the best performance is selected as the final model. The findings and interpretation of the model are communicated to non-technical stakeholders, providing explanations of the model's workings and the factors influencing the player's rank. Finally, if stakeholders wish to collect more data, we can provide guidance on what additional data to collect. Throughout the process, we aim to gather useful insights to be delivered to the stakeholders.
